 # Image Pyramids & Pyramid Blending
 
This exercise deals with image pyramids, low-pass and band-pass filtering, and their application in image
blending. In this exercise I constructed Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids, and used them to implement
pyramid blending, and finally compared the blending results when using different filters in the various
expand and reduce operations.

One of my blending examples:
